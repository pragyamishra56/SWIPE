# SWIPE - Real-Time Gesture Interaction

Welcome to **SWIPE**, a front-end project designed to demonstrate real-time gesture interactions using touch-based swipe gestures. This project highlights my skills in responsive web design, gesture recognition, and intuitive user interfaces.

## Project Overview

**SWIPE** is a responsive web application that detects and responds to user swipe gestures in real-time. The goal of this project is to showcase my front-end development skills by creating a smooth and interactive user experience across various devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Gesture Detection**: Implements real-time detection of swipe gestures (left, right, up, down).
- **Clean UI**: A minimalist, user-friendly interface that enhances usability.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures consistent performance across different web browsers.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling the application to be responsive and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handling the logic for swipe gesture detection and response.
